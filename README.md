By training models on the data derived from our simulations, we aim to predict the structure of dark matter halos with unprecedented accuracy. This endeavour not only contributes to our understanding of the universe's early stages but also paves the way for more sophisticated models that can simulate and predict the evolution of dark matter halos over cosmic time.
